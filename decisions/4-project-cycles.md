# Project Cycles

We will group timely chunks of work, but we are not attaching calendar expectations to them. We call them Cycles instead of Sprints.

## Problem Context

When managing a project, it can be helpful to group work together into units. Many teams will use the term Sprint and set calendar durations of 1-4 weeks per Sprint.

We want to group things but are less interested in the calendar due dates. We also do not like the connotations and baggage of the term Sprint.

## Decision Made

Inside the StudyHall project, we'll be using the term Cycle. As I write this, we are in `Cycle 1`.

There is no due date for a Cycle. This is because of the part-time nature of the project. It would not be helpful to plan for 1-2 weeks since it is questionable if enough work would get done in that time frame. While we could pick a large time frame, we choose no time frame to reduce project management overhead. We'll finish and close Cycles as we see fit to go with the ebbs and flows of development speed. 

Cycle scope is fluid right now, with lots of things expected to be added as we go. In time, I would expect Cycles to become more scoped.

## Consequences & Tradeoffs

Changing Cycles to be time-based or have firm scopes would not be that big of an impact (though GitHub Projects might not like the idea of any "iterations" without a date range). 

I'm documenting this careful choice of words and reasons as more of a mind share about the importance of little decisions.
