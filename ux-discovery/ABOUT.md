# About UX Discovery

In this folder we store the artifacts from various user experience research and discovery sessions. Generally the outcome of these sessions is guidance in the form of wireframes, notes and demos for how we expect feature to be developed.

## The Process

The following is an outline for how one might go about doing discovery.

### 1. Capture the problem.

Document the problem we are trying to help the user solve.

Take screenshots, screen recordings (to capture animations or other advanced interactions) and other wise document how other players are solving for this problem. Take notes for what you like and what you dislike.

### 2. Breadboard possible solutions.

[Breadboarding](https://basecamp.com/shapeup/1.3-chapter-04#breadboarding) is a text-based approach to documenting what the user will see and how they will interact with the page. It's a low cost way to capture some basic requirements and ideally will help you think of edge cases and variants before getting too deep into more expensive mockups.

### 3. Wireframe the breadboards

Visualize the breadboard flows into user interface wireframes. Create variants for error versions.
